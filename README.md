# arch-maintenence-script
My personal system maintenence script for arch linux

This script does some specific things such as updating using pacman, yay, flatpak, clearing cache of these package managers and also clears some caches of other places where i liked it to. 

It clears the cache of GNOME apps, Discord, Steam, waybar, nwg apps, rofi, firefox and temporary user files.

Then it shows some additional about failed systemd units and a disk usage summary.
